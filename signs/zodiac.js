There are two of them, both linked closely to the king of gods, Zeus (his Roman equivalent was Jupiter).",

While she was having fun with her friends on a sea shore, Zeus fell in love with her and approached her disguised as a while bull. Europa was attracted to the beauty and the meekness of the bull kneeling in front of her, and jumped on his back to ride him. With her on his back, he swam and took her across the water to Crete, where she gave birth to his three sons. After this, she married the Crete king Asterion from whom these children inherited the rule of the island.",
        three: "The second myth is in relation to Zeus' first infidelity to Hera, with Hera's personal priestess Io. When Hera realized she was being deceived, she got really angry. Zeus turned Io into a heifer in order to protect her from Hera's rage. Thanks to Argus, the all-seeing monster, Hera found out about this and cursed Io to wonder the world enchanted, as a cow, stung by a gadfly continuously, so she would be forced to wonder forever. After some time, Io finally crossed the Ionian sea to Egypt, where she was restored to human form by Zeus and gave birth to his two children, a son who is to become the king of Egypt and a daughter."

Their personality is marked by dualism, making them inconsistent but clever, and amazingly attractive to others. This man is impossible to cling to, and need a partner who gives him enough freedom and space, followed by mental stimulation and variety. To win his heart, one has to be fun, stimulating, adventurous, laughing at his jokes and ready to learn from him day after day. As if opposed to his eloquent nature, this isn't a man ready to discuss emotions that much, and will prefer if they are shown rather than spoken of.",
    AttractWoman:
        "If you want to attract a Gemini woman, you will have to be able to keep up with her dual nature. She can be passionate and gentle one moment, and aloof and distant the next. This is a result of her natural born tendency to stay safe and on a distance from other people, prepared to run off into a carefree love story that waits for her just around the corner. This is an enthusiastic, witty, intellectual and soft spoken woman, while at the same time extremely open-minded and always ready to meet someone new.",
    Myth: {
        one: "The myth of Gemini is a myth of Castor and Pollux, sons of Zeus and Leda. Leda was the wife of Tyndareus, king of Sparta. One of the versions of this myth states that Leda got seduced or raped by Zeus disguised as a swan, on the same night when she shared a bed with her husband. As a result, she hatched two eggs from which four children were born, mortal and immortal for they have different fathers, and among them - Castor and Pollux.",
        two: "Castor was the mortal twin brother, and Pollux was immortal. They never fought and loved each other greatly. Pollux was known for his boxing skills and Castor as a horse tamer. Brothers aspired to marry two women who were already betrothed to two of their cousins. This lead to a family feud and Castor was fatally wounded by one of the cousins as a consequence. Zeus gave a choice to Pollux - to spend every day as an immortal at Mount Olympus among the gods, or give half of his immortality to his brother Castor. He opted for the latter, and the twins shared life and death, by spending a day at Olympus together followed by a day at Hades - the underworld.",
        three: "The second story is connected to the birth of the twins, in which they weren't really Leda's sons. By this version of the myth, Zeus fell in love with Nemesis, who was the spirit of divine retribution against those who succumb to hubris (arrogance before gods). She represented inevitability of fate to those who were godless and evil. Zeus started chasing her, acting on strong attraction he felt, and she started changing shapes to escape him. When she transformed into a goose, Zeus found her, became a swan himself, and mated with her passionately. As a result, two eggs hatched, found by Leda in the swamp and she claimed them as her own."

As a result of the fight with the squid, he was crippled and because of his immortality, in pain forever.",

She is charming, intelligent, and finds solutions to problems that arise along the way with certain ease. Her partner needs to keep her interested and on her toes at first, making her question her own initiative and choices, while also straightforward and surprising enough.",
    Myth: {
        one: "There is a small mystery to the sign of Libra. On one hand, it is often connected to Astraea, the Greek goddess of innocence and purity, but this goddess is in general link to the sign of Virgo, Libra's preceding sign. On the other hand, the stars of Scorpio make the constellation of Libra. It is almost as if Libra was a connection of Virgo and Scorpio, more than a sign by itself.",
        two: "It is best correlated to Dike, the Greek goddess of justice, the daughter of Zeus. Even though she is often in correlation to Astraea, she still seems to be an individual independent of other signs of the zodiac. In service of her father Zeus, Dike was in charge of measuring the weight of human souls after they passed away. Her job was to punish souls mired in vice and reward souls that were honest and just. The link of Libra with Astraea is related to the role of Astraea after she gave up on the human race and decided to leave the humans to their corrupted nature.",

    Myth: {

She decided to send a scorpion to sting the hunter and prevent the kill. In the night sky, the constellation of Scorpio is in opposition with the constellations of Taurus and Orion. As Scorpio rises above the horizon, Orion falls below it, as if falling to its death.",
        two: "By a different myth, Orion threatened Artemis and her mother, Leto, that he would kill every animal on our planet, which made them angry enough to send a scorpion into a battle with Orion. The scorpion kills Orion with his sting and Zeus raised them both to the stars so mortals on Earth can understand the punishment for excessive pride. Another version of this myth speaks of Orion's hunting skills that turned out to be better than those of Artemis. Since he chose to protect her, saying that she is better at her calling, she starts developing feelings for him. Her twin brother Apollo grows angry because of her romantic feelings, and sends a scorpion to kill Orion.",
        three: "If we want to understand the sign of Scorpio, we have to understand that there is also a sexual side of the myth, in which Orion is seduced by the goddess of the dawn Eos, abducted by her as many other young men were. This made Artemis jealous and out of anger she sent the scorpion to sting Orion, once again."

Because of his talent for music, Muses requested that Zeus place him in the sky. This is when Zeus gave him two horse feet, a tail and a bow with an arrow because of his archery skills.

By mistake, he shot Chiron in his thigh, inflicting an incurable wound upon him.

One of the stories of Pan speaks of a gathering of gods that was interrupted by Typhon, the monstrous giant. Out of fear, all of the gods changed shape, while Pan jumped into the river Nile, turning his legs into a tail of the fish, and his torso to a goat, to confuse the monster and scare it away with his appearance.",

However, she was replaced by a young, beautiful man, presumed to be Zeus' lover and protégé. Hebe was Hera's daughter and the supreme goddess got angry because of this replacement. Because of constant fighting, frustrated Zeus simply put Ganymede into the stars.",

To compensate for taking away his son, Zeus gave the harness of divine horses and a golden vine to his father, the king of Troy. Ganymede was the first mortal to become immortal. It is important to understand that the duality is presented through the sign of Aquarius, as it shows waters “above” that support life.

Similar to fiery Sagittarians, Ophiuchans are thought to be passionate lovers who will fully immerse themselves in the adventure and thrill of romance. <br><br> Because the sign of Ophiuchus would fall in between Scorpio and Sagittarius in the zodiac, it's theorized that its astrological traits could be influenced by these signs, too. Ophiuchans would likely be intense and mysterious people with a powerful presence — somewhat similar to the way Scorpio zodiac signs are perceived. And like Sagittarius zodiac signs, they'd likely be blessed with good luck, a taste for adventure, and a great sense of humor.

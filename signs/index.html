                    <p>People born under the sign of Leo are natural born leaders. They are dramatic, creative,

                        specific strength to a Leo and their "king of the jungle" status. Leo often has many friends for
                        they are generous and

                    <h3>How To Attract The Leo Man :</h3>

                    <p>A Leo man wants to be treated like a king in their intimate relationship and this is not their
                        narcissistic
                        characteristic, but a true inner need that all people with deep self-respect have to feel. Plans
                        with him are always big
                        and dramatic, and showering with admiration, devotion and attention come really natural both
                        ways. This is a man who
                        gives many gifts when they are in love, often expensive and posing as a statement of his effort.
                        Any partner that wants
                        to stay with him has to prove that they are worthy of royal treatment and ready to give enough
                        of it back. A Leo man
                        will love compliments, and although he appears confident, he needs a lot of praise to start
                        feeling safe around their
                        loved one too.</p>

                    <h3>How To Attract The Leo Woman :</span></h3>
                    <p>
                        Leo women are very warm-hearted and driven by the desire to be loved and admired, and as all
                        people born under the Leo
                        zodiac sign, love to be in the limelight. To seduce her, one has to treat her well, respect her,
                        compliment her and see
                        her fit to live a luxurious lifestyle she deserves. She appreciates romantic partners and will
                        expect to be the center
                        of someone's world, giving the person she loves the same royal treatment. Dating a Leo woman
                        requires acceptance of her
                        flaws and admiration for her qualities. She doesn't like competing for love and wants to have
                        clarity on her role in her
                        partner's life.

                    <h3>The Myth Of Leo :</h3>

                    <p>Leo is connected to the first of twelve labors of the Greek hero Hercules, in which he had to
                        kill the notorious Nemean
                        Lion.</p>

                    <p>The Lion lived in a cave in Nemea and terrorized the people who lived there. There was no way to
                        defeat him because of
                        the impenetrable skin that could not be punctured by iron, bronze or stone. When Heracles found
                        it, he tried to shoot it
                        with arrows and they simply bounced of the lion's skin. When the lion entered his cave to hide,
                        Heracles started a
                        search for it. He needed two months to find it in that cave and finally strangled it, using its
                        own claws to get its
                        skin. This skin was made into a cloak, worn as a trophy and a reminder of Heracles' strength, as
                        well as a cloak of
                        protection that made him look even more fearsome.</p>

    Brief:
        "Scorpios are passionate and assertive people with determination and focus you rarely see in other zodiac signs. They will turn to in-depth research to reach the truth behind anything they find important. Great leaders and guides, Scorpios are resourceful, dedicated and fearless when there is challenge to be overcome. They will hold on to other people's secrets, even when they aren't very fond of them to begin with and do anything they can for those they tie themselves to.",
    AttractMan:
        "Scorpio men are tedious, confident, intense, sexual and very competitive. They can be highly obsessive, compulsive and jealous, and this is colored by blind dedication and all-giving love every one of us craves for. He needs a practical person to help him stick to his plans while at the same time surrounded by a bubble of mystery, intriguing and quiet enough. He enjoys the game of seduction and needs to feel surprised, guided, and followed to remain interested before he opens up. A Scorpio man needs a challenge and often chooses partners that are already taken or playing hard to get.",
    AttractWoman:
        "Scorpio personality is both complex and fascinating, and makes Scorpio women magnetic, sexy and mysteriously calm. She has a great capacity for kindness and a desire to good in the world, but needs someone to truly treasure her by her side and accept the level of control she needs in her love life. The partner she chooses belongs to her and has to be a good listener, willing to embrace shadows she has trouble accepting herself.",
    Myth: {
        one: "There are several versions of the myth of Scorpio, the first being the one in which Gaia (one of Greek primordial deities and the personification of Earth) got angry because a hunter named Orion wanted to kill a bull. She decided to send a scorpion to sting the hunter and prevent the kill. In the night sky, the constellation of Scorpio is in opposition with the constellations of Taurus and Orion. As Scorpio rises above the horizon, Orion falls below it, as if falling to its death.",
        two: "By a different myth, Orion threatened Artemis and her mother, Leto, that he would kill every animal on our planet, which made them angry enough to send a scorpion into a battle with Orion. The scorpion kills Orion with his sting and Zeus raised them both to the stars so mortals on Earth can understand the punishment for excessive pride. Another version of this myth speaks of Orion's hunting skills that turned out to be better than those of Artemis. Since he chose to protect her, saying that she is better at her calling, she starts developing feelings for him. Her twin brother Apollo grows angry because of her romantic feelings, and sends a scorpion to kill Orion.",
        three: "If we want to understand the sign of Scorpio, we have to understand that there is also a sexual side of the myth, in which Orion is seduced by the goddess of the dawn Eos, abducted by her as many other young men were. This made Artemis jealous and out of anger she sent the scorpion to sting Orion, once again."

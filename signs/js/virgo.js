    Brief:
        "Virgos are always paying attention to the smallest details and their deep sense of humanity makes them one of the most careful signs of the zodiac. Their methodical approach to life ensures that nothing is left to chance, and although they are often tender, their heart might be closed for the outer world. This is a sign often misunderstood, not because they lack the ability to express, but because they won't accept their feelings as valid, true, or even relevant when opposed to reason. The symbolism behind the name speaks well of their nature, born with a feeling they are experiencing everything for the first time.",
    AttractMan:
        "To seduce a Virgo man, one must respect his need for cleanliness and order. In most cases he enters romance slowly, carefully, and likes to take his time getting to know a person before starting anything serious. When he receives information on what to expect, his partner has to be sure to deliver nothing less. A Virgo man might put up a cool front, but don't let him fool you. He has deep and sensual needs, and only if his partner is patient enough, able to withstand his tendency to overanalyze everything, he will eventually warm up.",
    AttractWoman:
        "A Virgo personality is a mix of intelligence, attention to detail, common sense, and commitment, and a woman born with her in this sign is very smart, modest, and capable. Trying to seduce this woman can seem intimidating at first, for she is likely to put on a facade of indifference. However, she is not cold but practical, realistic and cautious when it comes to starting new relationships. She will never simply give herself to someone without assessing their character and emotions shared with her from the beginning.",
    Myth: {
        one: "The constellation of Virgo was often linked to Greek and Roman goddesses of Agriculture, Demetres and Ceres. Still, the primal connection of ancient Greeks connected this constellation to Astraea, the celestial virgin, who was the last immortal to live with humans during the Golden Age, one of the five deteriorating ages of man. She abandoned the human race and left the Earth to flee from the wickedness of humanity.",
        two: "The more intense myth linked with this constellation is the one of Erigone, daughter of Icarus. Icarus got killed by shepherds because they got drunk on his wine and thought he tried to poison them. As he was dying, he remembered how Dionysus taught him to care about the vine, and that one day a goat ate everything he has planted and grown with love and devotion. Angry, Icarus killed the goat, skinned it and invited other people to dance around it. At the moment of death, he realized that by killing the goat, he actually hurt himself.",
        three: "His daughter Erigone with her dog Maera, found her father's body under a tree and hanged herself over him. The dog stayed there sad for his owner, until he was dead too. But the story doesn't end here. Since Dionysus was so angry because of this unjust act, he punished Athens by making all of the city's maidens commit suicide in the same way, until the shepherds who killed Icarus were finally found and punished."

    Brief:
        "Pisces are very friendly and often find themselves in company of very different people. They are selfless and always willing to help others, a very fine intent for as long as they don't expect anything much in return. People born with their Sun in Pisces have an intuitive understanding of the life cycle and form incredible emotional relationship with other humans on the basis of natural order and senses guiding them.",
    AttractMan:
        "If a man is born with his Sun in the sign of Pisces lives only to love and please their partner. He needs a partner who is practical and caring, ready to keep at least one of his feet on the ground and connected to the material world. Sensitivity, compassion and kindness won't lack, but there could be a lot of shady activities in his spare time. He finds extreme joy in discovering presents their partner needs and buying them on any upcoming occasion.",
    AttractWoman:
        "This is a kind, imaginative, compassionate, selfless, and extremely sensitive woman. Attraction in her life is a matter of seconds and it either happens or it simply doesn't. She won't often feel it with people she knows for ages but has never been with. Although she seems calm, quiet, and set somewhere in the back line of defense, this is a woman who will never be boring in her sexual encounters.",
    Myth: {
        one: "The mythology behind the constellation of Pisces has its roots in Syria as Atagartis, the goddess of love and fertility. She was represented by a half-woman, half-fish figure, and is thought to be the inspiration for the Greek goddess Aphrodite and the Roman goddess Venus.",
        two: "Mostly, the constellation of Pisces is linked to the story of Aphrodite and her son Eros, who escaped from the monster Typhon by leaping into the sea and transforming themselves into fish. By a different version, they were by the river Euphrates at the time, and jumped into the river, not the sea. When they jumped into the water, they tied themselves together with rope, in order not to lose each other. On Syrian shores of river Euphrates, eating fish is still considered taboo.",
        three: "There is another version of this myth in which Aphrodite and Eros jumped into the water and two fish came to their rescue."

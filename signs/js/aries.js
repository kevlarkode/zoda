    Brief:
        "As the first sign in the zodiac, the presence of Aries always marks the beginning of something energetic and turbulent.They are continuously looking for dynamic, speed and competition, always being the first in everything - from work to social gatherings.Thanks to its ruling planet Mars and the fact it belongs to the element of Fire(just like Leo and Sagittarius), Aries is one of the most active zodiac signs.It is in their nature to take action, sometimes before they think about it.",
    AttractMan:
        "Independence is the key to understanding an Aries, for they don't like to take orders from others. In order to seduce an Aries man, you need to learn to play the game by his rules. This man often finds the chase for the subject of his desire more thrilling than the catch, and his conquering nature makes him often chase after partners he can't have.To get his attention, one must play hard to get, as if sending a message that he needs to fight for a prize, and winning the one he truly wants to be with.",
    AttractWoman:
        "Aries women are fearless and natural leaders.They are energetic, charismatic, dynamic, and in love with challenges and adventures.If you want to attract the attention of an Aries woman, you must let her seduce you and appeal to her independent nature.A woman born under the Aries zodiac sign is extremely passionate and sexual, which makes her irresistible to the opposite sex.She is constantly on the move and will never allow herself to be overrun by a man, at the same time craving for love but trying to hold on to control.",
    Myth: {
        one: "The ram with the Golden Fleece was conceived in an unusual way.Poseidon, the god of the sea, turned a nymph into a sheep, so he would distance her from many suitors she had. In order to have sexual relations with her, he had to turn himself into a ram and as a result, the nymph gave birth to a ram with the Golden Fleece.",
        two: "Not only did this ram have a Golden Fleece, but it could also fly and he is most famous for his help to a mother of two children, a boy and a girl, Phrixus and Helle.They were the children of Nephele and Athamas who got divorced for Athamas' second wife, Ino. In order to justify the separation, he accused his first wife, the mother of his children Nephele for insanity.",
        three: "When her son was wrongly accused of rape and she realized that both of her children's lives were in danger, Nephele gave them to a ram hoping he would fly them away from their stepmother.While flying through the narrow passage between Europe and Asia, Helle fell of the ram taking one of his horns with her.It is said that the god of sea Poseidon purposefully saved her in order to rape her(although this was referred to as “sacrifice to gods”) and she gave birth to his son afterwards.",
        four: "Phrixus arrived safe to his destination and as a sign of gratitude, sacrificed the same ram to Zeus and gave his golden fleece to his father in law, who locked it away and assigned a dragon to keep it safe."

    Myth: {
        one: "There's a dilemma in regards to the myth of this constellation. By one interpretation, Sagittarius is a centaur shooting an arrow, but the constellation doesn't show a creature with four legs. Because of this, it is viewed either as the satyr Crotus, the son of Pan, or as Chiron, son of Saturn.",
        two: "Greeks credited Crotus with the invention of archery. He was considered a great huntsman and an even better musician, raised and lived with the Muses. Because of his talent for music, Muses requested that Zeus place him in the sky. This is when Zeus gave him two horse feet, a tail and a bow with an arrow because of his archery skills. His music inspired the Muses to applaud to him, and this was the mythological explanation on how applause came to existence.",
        three: "Chiron, on the other hand, was the first astrologer and the only centaur that didn't give in to his animalistic tendencies. He was a teacher and a healer, who was also immortal and badly hurt by his friend, Hercules. Hercules was chasing other centaurs who stole his wine, shooting at them with poisonous arrows. By mistake, he shot Chiron in his thigh, inflicting an incurable wound upon him. Chiron's pain was unbearable and he begged Zeus to give his immortality to Prometheus, to take his place in the Underworld. In his wish to finally die and stop feeling the pain, Chiron gave his immortality away and saved someone's life.",

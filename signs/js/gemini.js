    Brief:
        "Expressive and quick-witted, Gemini represents two different personalities in one and you will never be sure which one you will face. They are sociable, communicative and ready for fun, with a tendency to suddenly get serious, thoughtful and restless. They are fascinated with the world itself, extremely curious, with a constant feeling that there is not enough time to experience everything they want to see.",
    AttractMan:
        "A Gemini man is enthusiastic and full of life, never disappointing with dull moments. He is adventurous and humorous, and this makes him the perfect partner if a person is energetic and dynamic, in search for some laughter and fun. Gemini men are naturally chatty and flirtatious, and you can meet them at public gatherings, conferences, and traffic jams. Their personality is marked by dualism, making them inconsistent but clever, and amazingly attractive to others. This man is impossible to cling to, and need a partner who gives him enough freedom and space, followed by mental stimulation and variety. To win his heart, one has to be fun, stimulating, adventurous, laughing at his jokes and ready to learn from him day after day. As if opposed to his eloquent nature, this isn't a man ready to discuss emotions that much, and will prefer if they are shown rather than spoken of.",
    AttractWoman:
        "If you want to attract a Gemini woman, you will have to be able to keep up with her dual nature. She can be passionate and gentle one moment, and aloof and distant the next. This is a result of her natural born tendency to stay safe and on a distance from other people, prepared to run off into a carefree love story that waits for her just around the corner. This is an enthusiastic, witty, intellectual and soft spoken woman, while at the same time extremely open-minded and always ready to meet someone new.",
    Myth: {
        one: "The myth of Gemini is a myth of Castor and Pollux, sons of Zeus and Leda. Leda was the wife of Tyndareus, king of Sparta. One of the versions of this myth states that Leda got seduced or raped by Zeus disguised as a swan, on the same night when she shared a bed with her husband. As a result, she hatched two eggs from which four children were born, mortal and immortal for they have different fathers, and among them - Castor and Pollux.",
        two: "Castor was the mortal twin brother, and Pollux was immortal. They never fought and loved each other greatly. Pollux was known for his boxing skills and Castor as a horse tamer. Brothers aspired to marry two women who were already betrothed to two of their cousins. This lead to a family feud and Castor was fatally wounded by one of the cousins as a consequence. Zeus gave a choice to Pollux - to spend every day as an immortal at Mount Olympus among the gods, or give half of his immortality to his brother Castor. He opted for the latter, and the twins shared life and death, by spending a day at Olympus together followed by a day at Hades - the underworld.",
        three: "The second story is connected to the birth of the twins, in which they weren't really Leda's sons. By this version of the myth, Zeus fell in love with Nemesis, who was the spirit of divine retribution against those who succumb to hubris (arrogance before gods). She represented inevitability of fate to those who were godless and evil. Zeus started chasing her, acting on strong attraction he felt, and she started changing shapes to escape him. When she transformed into a goose, Zeus found her, became a swan himself, and mated with her passionately. As a result, two eggs hatched, found by Leda in the swamp and she claimed them as her own."

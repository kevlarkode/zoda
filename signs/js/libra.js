    Brief:
        "People born under the sign of Libra are peaceful, fair, and they hate being alone. Partnership is very important for them, seeking someone with the ability to be the mirror to themselves. These individuals are fascinated by balance and symmetry, they are in a constant chase for justice and equality, realizing through life that the only thing that should be truly important to themselves in their own inner core of personality. This is someone ready to do nearly anything to avoid conflict, keeping the peace whenever possible.",
    AttractMan:
        "Libra men appreciate all that is beautiful and search for a partner to inspire them with their appearance. This might sound superficial, but the fact is they need mental and visual stimuli to make decision processes easier and push them into a serious relationship to begin with. Once they have decided to be with someone, they usually make serious, long-term bonds, enduring with ease through the hard times knowing they have already made the perfect choice to begin with. A Libra man wants to discuss everything with his partner, from daily matters to big shared endeavors in life.",
    AttractWoman:
        "To seduce a Libra woman one has to be a good conversationalist and listener. She enjoys being taught about new things and enjoys talking about herself and her personal interests, just as much as she likes sinking deep into her partner's life. She is charming, intelligent, and finds solutions to problems that arise along the way with certain ease. Her partner needs to keep her interested and on her toes at first, making her question her own initiative and choices, while also straightforward and surprising enough.",
    Myth: {
        one: "There is a small mystery to the sign of Libra. On one hand, it is often connected to Astraea, the Greek goddess of innocence and purity, but this goddess is in general link to the sign of Virgo, Libra's preceding sign. On the other hand, the stars of Scorpio make the constellation of Libra. It is almost as if Libra was a connection of Virgo and Scorpio, more than a sign by itself.",
        two: "It is best correlated to Dike, the Greek goddess of justice, the daughter of Zeus. Even though she is often in correlation to Astraea, she still seems to be an individual independent of other signs of the zodiac. In service of her father Zeus, Dike was in charge of measuring the weight of human souls after they passed away. Her job was to punish souls mired in vice and reward souls that were honest and just. The link of Libra with Astraea is related to the role of Astraea after she gave up on the human race and decided to leave the humans to their corrupted nature.",

    Brief:
        "Deeply intuitive and sentimental, Cancer can be one of the most challenging zodiac signs to get to know. They are very emotional and sensitive, and care deeply about matters of the family and their home. Cancer is sympathetic and attached to people they keep close. Those born with their Sun in Cancer are very loyal and able to empathize with other people's pain and suffering.",
    AttractMan:
        "A Cancer man is conservative just enough to know that initiative is important, but often fails to show it before he feels safe to do so. His partners need to make the first move, but still doing it subtly to let him still feel like he is leading the way. This is a complex individual, very sensitive, shy and overly protective of his loved ones. When he prefers women, he will subconsciously search for the ideal wife and mother.",
    AttractWoman:
        "Cancer personality can be quite complicated, but deep inside they are home-loving and conservative people. A Cancer woman is vulnerable, emotional, and not likely to quickly fall in love. Once her trust is earned, she will be passionate and loyal. In order to seduce her, one has to be proactive and make the first move, respecting her need to be treated like a lady. She is not the right choice for someone in search for a one-night stand, and needs more from her partner than just casual encounters. Romantic and ready to love, this woman needs a romantic partner who believes in love, while also in tune with her unspoken feelings.",
    Myth: {
        one: "The myth of Cancer is probably the shortest myth of all. It speaks about a family mess as a consequence of one of Zeus' infidelities that resulted in birth of Heracles, one of the greatest Greek heroes. Hera, the wife of Zeus, hated Heracles out of jealousy and wanted him gone. While he was fighting the great Hydra, out of love for Hera, a crab sneaked in and pinched Heracles' foot. As a result, he smashed the crab with one step, and that is mostly the end of it.",
        two: "There is mention of another way to interpret Cancer, through the role of the giant crab that Poseidon, the god of the sea, put in charge to keep his nymphs safe. He was mostly successful in his endeavors, but got tricked by the “vampire squid” that he sent to save a couple of nymphs who got away. As a result of the fight with the squid, he was crippled and because of his immortality, in pain forever.",

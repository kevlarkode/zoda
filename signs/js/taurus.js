    Brief:
        "Practical and well-grounded, Taurus is the sign that harvests the fruits of labor. They feel the need to always be surrounded by love and beauty, turned to the material world, hedonism, and physical pleasures. People born with their Sun in Taurus are sensual and tactile, considering touch and taste the most important of all senses. Stable and conservative, this is one of the most reliable signs of the zodiac, ready to endure and stick to their choices until they reach the point of personal satisfaction.",
    AttractMan:
        "If you are in search for a strong, loyal and generous man, Taurus is the person you are looking for. He is trustworthy, patient and tender when in love, always in search for a returned emotion. He will not pick on subtle hinds and suggestive looks from those who flirt with him, being a bit slow on the uptake as if waiting for someone to ask them out. He dislikes artificiality of any kind, and values conversations filled with genuine statements, especially when it comes to compliments and love declarations.",
    AttractWoman:
        "If you want to seduce a woman born with her Sun in Taurus, you will need to appeal to her sense of romance. Taurus women want to be courted and slowly seduced, even when they have already decided to enter a relationship with someone. They need things to move slowly, and will rarely jump into a sexual bond quickly and without thinking long and hard about her choices.",
    Myth: {
        one: "In the Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest works of literature, Taurus is sent by the goddess Ishtar to kill Gilgamesh for spurning her advances, while in early Mesopotamian art it was closely associated with Innana, the Sumerian goddess of sexual love, fertility and warfare. Although many cultures have had a story connected to the sign of Taurus, the most vivid myths are those from ancient Greece. There are two of them, both linked closely to the king of gods, Zeus (his Roman equivalent was Jupiter).",
        two: "The first myth links Taurus to Zeus abducting Europa, a legendary Phoenician princess. While she was having fun with her friends on a sea shore, Zeus fell in love with her and approached her disguised as a while bull. Europa was attracted to the beauty and the meekness of the bull kneeling in front of her, and jumped on his back to ride him. With her on his back, he swam and took her across the water to Crete, where she gave birth to his three sons. After this, she married the Crete king Asterion from whom these children inherited the rule of the island.",
        three: "The second myth is in relation to Zeus' first infidelity to Hera, with Hera's personal priestess Io. When Hera realized she was being deceived, she got really angry. Zeus turned Io into a heifer in order to protect her from Hera's rage. Thanks to Argus, the all-seeing monster, Hera found out about this and cursed Io to wonder the world enchanted, as a cow, stung by a gadfly continuously, so she would be forced to wonder forever. After some time, Io finally crossed the Ionian sea to Egypt, where she was restored to human form by Zeus and gave birth to his two children, a son who is to become the king of Egypt and a daughter."

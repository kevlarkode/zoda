    Brief:
        "Aquarius is the sign different from the rest of the zodiac and people born with their Sun in it feel special. This makes them eccentric and energetic in their fight for freedom, or at times shy and quiet, afraid to express their true personality. In both cases they are deep thinkers and highly intellectual people who love to fight for idealistic causes. They are able to see people without prejudice and this makes them truly special. Although they can easily adapt to the energy that surrounds them, Aquarius representatives have a deep need to have some time alone and away from everything in order to restore power.",
    AttractMan:
        "Aquarius men are unpredictable, intelligent, social, independent and excellent communicators. They are also unreliable and inflexible, but changed by the right partner at least up to a point where they check time on their wrist watch. An Aquarius man sometimes lives inside his mind, and needs a companion to talk about his progressive thoughts and ideas. In a game of seduction, one must first become their friend and everything else will come second. As things fall into place and he discovers he found trust for the person standing in front of them, each Aquarius has a chance to meet their own boundaries and see if there is anything else they need to break.",
    AttractWoman:
        "She is independent, mysterious, free-spirited and eccentric, with a fine sense of humor and a strange inability to stay consistent and present. She seems cold and aloof but needs someone to romance her senseless and to share a good conversations with. Truly exciting, this is a woman who makes an excellent partner in emotional, sexual, and especially mental issues, but her dedication might not hold her for very long if she feels even an ounce of disrespect along the way. She is drawn to people who stand out from the crown and needs someone to build her trust and take her by the hand and into better circumstances.",
    Myth: {
        one: "Although there is a connection to Deucalion, who built a ship with his wife to survive an imminent flood, the story that usually follows the constellation of Aquarius is the myth of Ganymede.",
        two: "Ganymede was the most beautiful boy of that time, who was abducted by the gods because of his beauty and taken to Mount Olympus where he replaced Hebe as Zeus' a cupbearer. There is a version of the myth in which Hebe lost her job when she tripped and her dress came undone, exposing her breasts. However, she was replaced by a young, beautiful man, presumed to be Zeus' lover and protégé. Hebe was Hera's daughter and the supreme goddess got angry because of this replacement. Because of constant fighting, frustrated Zeus simply put Ganymede into the stars.",
        three: "By one version of the myth, Ganymede was taken by Aquila (one of neighboring constellations), Zeus' eagle. By another, Zeus transformed into an eagle himself and abducted him. To compensate for taking away his son, Zeus gave the harness of divine horses and a golden vine to his father, the king of Troy. Ganymede was the first mortal to become immortal. It is important to understand that the duality is presented through the sign of Aquarius, as it shows waters “above” that support life. This means that Ganymede was actually the first mortal who understood that which comes from above and gave this information to common people.",
